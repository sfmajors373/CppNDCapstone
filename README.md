# CppNDCapstone
Capstone for C++ Nanodegree

# Steps to Build

    mkdir build
    cd build
    mkdir data
    Download MNIST dataset into data directory
    cmake ..
    make
    ./mnist


# LeNet

Because my interest in C++ stems from my interests in machine learning and artificial intelligence, I opted to do my capstone project in this area.  I recreated [LeNet 5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).  This was chosen because it is now a simple enough neural net to be understood and recreated with my still rudimentary understanding of C++, despite being a groundbreaking method 20 years ago.

## File Structure

## Class Structure

## Expected Output



## Rubric

For the completion of the capstone project, I must satisfy four mandatory criteria as well as an additional five of my choosing.  The [rubric](./UdacityCapstoneRubric.pdf) can be found in the repository as well.  Below I will discuss each of the criteria.

### A README with instructions is included with project

 - [ ] README is included with the project and has instructions for building/running the project
 - [ ] If any additional libraries are needed to run the project, these are indicated with cross-platform installation instructions.
 - [x] Markdown or pdf: Markdown is chosen

### The README indicates which project is chosen

 - [ ] The README describes the project you have built.
 - [ ] The README also indicates the file and class structure, along with the expected behavior or output of the program

### The README includes information about each rubric point addressed

 - [ ] The README indicates which rubric points are addressed.  The README also indicates where in the code (i.e. files and line numbers) that the rubric points are addressed.

### The submission must compile and run

 - [ ] The project code must compile and run without errors
 - [ ] Code must compile on any reviewer platform
