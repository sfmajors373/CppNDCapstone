# LeNet

Because my interest in C++ stems from my interests in machine learning and artificial intelligence, I opted to do my capstone project in this area.  I recreated [LeNet 5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).  This was chosen because it is now a simple enough neural net to be understood and recreated with my still rudimentary understanding of C++, despite being a groundbreaking method 20 years ago.
